# About
This repo aims to solve the problems at https://projecteuler.net.  
each file contains the solution to their respective problem, identifying them with the file names being the same as the problem's ID. Each file also has the problem's instructions as a comment in the first few lines.

Every solution will be indexed in this README.md file, with links leading to their respective file.

My main objective is to improve my mathematical and coding skills.
